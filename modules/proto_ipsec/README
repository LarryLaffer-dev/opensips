Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The proto_ipsec module provides IPSec sockets for establishing
   secure communication channels. It relies on RFC 3329 (Security
   Mechanism Agreement for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP))
   to establish the IPSec parameters necessary for creating
   dynamic Security Associations (SAs) for each connection.

   This module has been developed to fully comply with the VoLTE
   specification (GSMA PRD IR.92) and implements the extensions
   defined in TS 33.203 (3G Security: Access Security for IP-based
   Services).

   The module also supports IPSec NAT Traversal (NAT-T) as
   specified in 3GPP TS 33.203 Annex M and TS 24.229. When NAT-T
   is enabled, the module can accept and use the mod=UDP-enc-tun
   mode in Security-Client headers, which encapsulates ESP packets
   in UDP datagrams (as per RFC 3948) to traverse NAT devices.
   This feature is optional and can be enabled via the
   nat_traversal parameter.

   It allows creation of both UDP and TCP secure connections on
   the same IP:port pair, defined as sockets. Essentially, when
   defining a socket using the proto_ipsec protocol, two new
   internal/hidden sockets are created on the specified port. For
   example, defining the following socket:

...
socket=ipsec:127.0.0.1:5100
...

   Internally, two different sockets are created:

...
socket=udp:127.0.0.1:5100
socket=tcp:127.0.0.1:5100
...

   Communication through these sockets should be done over IPSec,
   thus appropriate security associations (SAs) should be made
   prior to using these listeners, as defined in RFC 3329.

   NOTE that this means that you can no longer define these
   sockets in your config, otherwise they will overlap with the
   internally defined ones.

   IPSec communication requires each participant to define at
   least two ports for each connection: one when the entity
   behaves as a client and another when it behaves as a server.
   Consequently, it's typically necessary to define at least two
   IPSec sockets for the module to function correctly.

   The module implements the entire logic of keeping track of the
   registration status by hooking into the usrloc module and
   listening for contact changes updates. It also ensures the
   persistency of the tunnels by restoring them after a restart.

   When a request is received over an IPSec tunnel, the module
   provides two variables, $ipsec(field) and $ipsec_ue(field) to
   inspect details about it.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * tm - used to keep track of IPSec SA context between
       requests and replies.
     * usrloc - used to identify when a successful
       registration/de-registration happens.
     * proto_udp - used for handling IPSec UDP connections
       operations.
     * proto_tcp - used for handling IPSec TCP connections
       operations.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * libmnl - Minimalistic Netlink Library used to create IPSec
       SA using the XFRM kernel interface.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. port (integer)

   Default IPSec port used when no prot is being specified in the
   socket global parameter.

   Default value is 5062.

   Example 1.1. Set port parameter
...
modparam("proto_ipsec", "port", 5100)
...

1.3.2. min_spi (integer)

   This parameter represents the minimum value for the Security
   Association's (SA) SPI parameter. In conjunction with the
   max_spi setting, it defines the SPI range [min_spi, max_spi]
   that must be unique within the system.

   Default value is 65536.

   Example 1.2. Set min_spi parameter
...
modparam("proto_ipsec", "min_spi", 10000)
...

1.3.3. max_spi (integer)

   This parameter represents the maximum value for the Security
   Association's (SA) SPI parameter. In conjunction with the
   min_spi setting, it defines the SPI range [min_spi, max_spi]
   that must be unique within the system.

   Default value is 262144.

   Example 1.3. Set max_spi parameter
...
modparam("proto_ipsec", "max_spi", 20000)
...

1.3.4. temporary_timeout (integer)

   Sets the timeout (in seconds) a temporary security association
   can be stored in memory until in is confirmed (or used) by the
   remote endpoint.

   The timeout signifies the duration elapsed after sending the
   Security Association's (SA) parameters in the 401 reply and
   when the User Equipment (UE) transmits the initial message over
   the new secure channel.

   Default value is 30.

   Example 1.4. Set temporary_timeout variable

param("proto_ipsec", "temporary_timeout", 10) # number of seconds


1.3.5. default_client_port (integer)

   Default port value to be used when we act as clients in the
   IPSec communication.

   Default value is not defined - a random socket is being used,
   but needs to be different from the server socket.

   Example 1.5. Set default_client_port parameter
...
modparam("proto_ipsec", "default_client_port", 5100)
...

1.3.6. default_server_port (integer)

   Default port value to be used when we act as server in the
   IPSec communication.

   Default value is not defined - a random socket is being used,
   but needs to be different from the client socket.

   Example 1.6. Set default_server_port parameter
...
modparam("proto_ipsec", "default_server_port", 6100)
...

1.3.7. allowed_algorithms (string)

   Whitelists the authentication and encryption algorithms that
   can be used for IPSec.

   Its format is: alg|ealg|alg=ealg

   Multiple algorithms pairs can be specified separated by comma.

   Currently supported algorithms are:
     * Authentication algorithms:
          + hmac-md5-96
          + hmac-sha-1-96
          + aes-gmac
          + null
     * Encryption algorithms:
          + des-ede3-cbc
          + aes-cbc
          + aes-gcm
          + null

   Default value is none - this means that all algorithms can be
   used.

   Example 1.7. Set allowed_algorithms parameter
...
modparam("proto_ipsec", "allowed_algorithms", "null")
modparam("proto_ipsec", "allowed_algorithms", "hmac-sha-1-96=null")
modparam("proto_ipsec", "allowed_algorithms", "hmac-sha-1-96=null,aes-gm
ac=aes-gcm")
...

1.3.8. disable_deprecated_algorithms (integer)

   Indicates whether we should ignore deprecated algorithms, as
   defined in TS 33.203 (3G Security: Access Security for IP-based
   Services). At the moment, this disables the following
   algorithms:
     * hmac-md5-96 and hmac-sha-1-96 authentication algorithms
     * des-ede3-cbc and aes-cbc encryption algorithms

   Default value is false - all algorithms can be used.

   Example 1.8. Set disable_deprecated_algorithms parameter
...
modparam("proto_ipsec", "disable_deprecated_algorithms", yes)
...

1.3.9. nat_traversal (integer)

   Enables or disables IPSec NAT Traversal (NAT-T) support
   according to 3GPP TS 33.203 Annex M and TS 24.229.

   When enabled (set to 1), the module will:
     * Accept mod=UDP-enc-tun in Security-Client headers
     * Use UDP encapsulation for ESP packets (RFC 3948) when NAT-T
       mode is negotiated
     * Use tunnel mode instead of transport mode for IPSec SAs
     * Include mod=UDP-enc-tun in Security-Server headers when the
       UE requests NAT-T mode

   When disabled (set to 0, default), only mod=trans (standard
   transport mode) is accepted in Security-Client headers.

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.9. Set nat_traversal parameter
...
# Enable NAT Traversal support for UEs behind NAT
modparam("proto_ipsec", "nat_traversal", 1)
...

1.3.10. hw_offload_interface (string)

   Enables hardware offload for IPSec ESP processing by specifying
   the network interface to use for offloading.

   Modern NICs can offload ESP encryption/decryption and integrity
   checks to hardware, significantly improving performance and
   reducing CPU load. Supported NICs include:
     * Mellanox/NVIDIA ConnectX-6 Dx and later
     * Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT)
     * Marvell OCTEON series

   If hardware offload fails (unsupported NIC, driver issues, or
   resource exhaustion), the module automatically falls back to
   software processing. This ensures reliability while attempting
   to leverage hardware acceleration when available.

   How to find your interface name:

   Use one of the following commands to list network interfaces
   and their indices:
# List all interfaces with their indices
ip link show

# Or using the traditional command
ifconfig -a

# Get interface index for a specific interface (e.g., eth0)
cat /sys/class/net/eth0/ifindex

# List interfaces that support IPSec offload (if supported)
ethtool -k eth0 | grep esp

   Prerequisites for hardware offload:
     * NIC driver must support XFRM offload (check with ethtool -k
       <interface> | grep esp)
     * Linux kernel 4.19 or later with CONFIG_XFRM_OFFLOAD enabled
     * The interface must be the one handling IPSec traffic

   Default value is NULL (hardware offload disabled).

   Example 1.10. Set hw_offload_interface parameter
...
# Enable hardware offload on interface eth0
modparam("proto_ipsec", "hw_offload_interface", "eth0")

# Or for a different interface name
modparam("proto_ipsec", "hw_offload_interface", "ens192")
...

   Example 1.11. Verifying hardware offload capability
# Check if your NIC supports IPSec offload
$ ethtool -k eth0 | grep esp
esp-hw-offload: on
esp-tx-csum-hw-offload: on

# If you see "off" or "[not requested]", the NIC may not support offload
# or it needs to be enabled:
$ ethtool -K eth0 esp-hw-offload on

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1.  ipsec_create([port_server], [port_client], [algos])

   Creates an IPSec SA/tunnel according to the Security-Client
   header and the AKA information received in the 401 reply.

   This function should only be called on a 401 reply for a
   REGISTER message.

   Upon successful creation of the IPSec tunnel, it builds the
   Security-Server header and appends it to the reply.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * port_server (integer, optional) - the server port to be
       used in the IPSec communication. It should be an existing
       IPSec port and is advertised in the Security-Server header.
       If missing, the default_client_port is considered.
     * port_client (integer, optional) - the client port to be
       used in the IPSec communication. It should be an existing
       IPSec port and is advertised in the Security-Server header.
       If missing, the default_server_port is considered.
     * algos (string, optional) - a list of algorithms that should
       be used for creating this security association. It has the
       same format as disable_allowed_algorithms and overwrites
       its value when used. If missing, the
       disable_allowed_algorithms is considered.

   This function can be used from REPLY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.12. ipsec_create() usage
...
onreply_route[ipsec] {
        if ($T_reply_code == 401)
                if (ipsec_create())
}
...

1.5. Exported Pseudo-Variables

1.5.1. $ipsec
